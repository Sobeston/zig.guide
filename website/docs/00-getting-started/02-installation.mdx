# Installation

<Tabs
    defaultValue="linux"
    values={[
        {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
        {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
        {label: 'macOS', value: 'macos'},
    ]}>
    <TabItem value="linux">
    Consider getting Zig from your distribution's [package manager](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Install-Zig-from-a-Package-Manager). Most major linux distros package the latest Zig release.

    ### Installing manually

    1. [Download](https://ziglang.org/download/#release-0.11.0) a prebuilt version of Zig.

        Choose a build of Zig 0.11 for linux that matches your CPU architecture. If you're unsure which architecture you're using, this can be found with:

        ```bash
        uname -m
        ```

    2. Extract the archive using tar, e.g.

        ```bash
        tar xf zig-linux-x86_64-0.11.0.tar.xz
        ```

    3. Add the location of your Zig binary to your path, e.g.

        ```bash
        echo 'export PATH="$HOME/zig-linux-x86_64-0.11.0:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="windows">
    Consider getting Zig from a package manager such as [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), [scoop](https://scoop.sh/), or [winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/#install-winget).

    All commands shown are to be used inside powershell.

    ```powershell
    choco install zig
    ```
    ```
    winget install zig.zig
    ```
    ```
    scoop install zig
    ```

    ### Installing manually

    1. [Download](https://ziglang.org/download/#release-0.11.0) a prebuilt version of Zig.

        Choose a build of Zig 0.11 for windows that matches your CPU architecture. Most Windows systems use `x86_64`, also known as `AMD64`. If you're unsure which architecture you're using, this can be found with:

        ```powershell
        $Env:PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE
        ```

    2. Extract Zig.

    3. Add Zig to your path:

        <Tabs
        defaultValue="user"
        values={[
            {label: 'Current User', value: 'user'},
            {label: 'System Wide', value: 'system'},
        ]}>
        <TabItem value="user">

        ```powershell
        [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(
            "Path",
            [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User") + ";C:\_\zig-windows-_",
            "User"
        )
        ```
        </TabItem>

        <TabItem value="system">

        ```powershell
        [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(
            "Path",
            [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "Machine") + ";C:\_\zig-windows-_",
            "Machine"
        )
        ```
        </TabItem>
        </Tabs>

        Close your terminal and create a new one.


    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="macos">
    Consider getting Zig from a package manager such as [brew](https://brew.sh/).

    ```
    brew install zig
    ```

    Alternatively, you could build zig from source. This will keep you up to date with the latest master branch of zig. Start by    cloning the `ziglang/zig` repo

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ziglang/zig.git
    ```
    
    then run these commands to get ready to build
    
    ```bash
    cd zig
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```
    
    Then you can begin the build process, you will need to have `cmake` installed on your system. You will also need to make sure you have the `zstd` and `llvm` libraries installed on your system via `homebrew`.
    ```bash
   cmake .. -DZIG_STATIC_LLVM=ON -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$(brew --prefix llvm);$(brew --prefix zstd)"
    ```

    It is necessary to update the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` as shown above when running your `cmake` command. Otherwise, `cmake` will not be able to properly link those libraries and the project will fail to compile.

    Once this command has been run, you can run

    ```bash
    make install
    ```

    to begin building. Do note that this will take some time to complete.

    Once this is done, you will want to add the zig binary to your system's `$PATH`. You can either manually copy the `zig` binary to `/usr/local/bin/zig` and the zig library directory to `/usr/local/lib/zig`.

    Alternatively, you can just update your `.bashrc` to create an alias linking `zig` to wherever the zig binary actually resides.

    ```bash
    alias zig=/usr/local/zig/build/stage3/bin/zig
    ```
    
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Verifying your install

Verify your installation with `zig version`. The output should look like this:

```
$ zig version
0.11.0
```

### Extras

For completions and go-to-definition in your editor, consider installing the [Zig Language Server](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/#installation).

Consider joining a [Zig community](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Community).
