# Pointers

Normal pointers in Zig cannot have 0 or null as a value. They follow the syntax
`*T`, where `T` is the child type.

Referencing is done with `&variable`, and dereferencing is done with
`variable.*`.

```zig
fn increment(num: *u8) void {
    num.* += 1;
}

test "pointers" {
    var x: u8 = 1;
    increment(&x);
    try expect(x == 2);
}
```

Trying to set a `*T` to the value 0 is detectable illegal behaviour.

```zig
test "naughty pointer" {
    var x: u16 = 0;
    var y: *u8 = @ptrFromInt(x);
    _ = y;
}
```

```
Test [23/126] test.naughty pointer... thread 21598 panic: cast causes pointer to be null
./test-c1.zig:252:18: 0x260a91 in test.naughty pointer (test)
    var y: *u8 = @ptrFromInt(x);
                 ^
```

Zig also has const pointers, which cannot be used to modify the referenced data.
Referencing a const variable will yield a const pointer.

<!--fail_test-->

```zig
test "const pointers" {
    const x: u8 = 1;
    var y = &x;
    y.* += 1;
}
```

```
error: cannot assign to constant
    y.* += 1;
        ^
```

A `*T` coerces to a `*const T`.
