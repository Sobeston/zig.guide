# Defer

Defer is used to execute a statement while exiting the current block.

<CodeBlock language="zig">{Defer}</CodeBlock>

When there are multiple defers in a single block, they are executed in reverse
order.

<CodeBlock language="zig">{DeferMulti}</CodeBlock>

Defer is useful to ensure that resources are cleaned up when they are no longer needed.
Instead of needing to remember to manually free up the resource,
you can add a defer statement right next to the statement which allocates that resource.
