# Errors

An error set is like an enum (details on Zig's enums later), where each error in
the set is a value. There are no exceptions in Zig; errors are values. Let's
create an error set.

<CodeBlock language="zig">{ErrorSet}</CodeBlock>

Error sets coerce to their supersets.

<CodeBlock language="zig">{ErrorSetCoercion}</CodeBlock>

An error set type and another type can be combined with the `!` operator to form
an error union type. Values of these types may be an error value or a value of
the other type.

Let's create a value of an error union type. Here
[`catch`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#catch) is used, which is
followed by an expression which is evaluated when the value preceding it is an
error. The catch here is used to provide a fallback value, but could instead be
a [`noreturn`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#noreturn) - the type of
`return`, `while (true)` and others.

<CodeBlock language="zig">{ErrorUnion}</CodeBlock>

Functions often return error unions. Here's one using a catch, where the `|err|`
syntax receives the value of the error. This is called **payload capturing**,
and is used similarly in many places. We'll talk about it in more detail later
in the chapter. Side note: some languages use similar syntax for lambdas - this
is not true for Zig.

<CodeBlock language="zig">{ErrorPayloadCapture}</CodeBlock>

`try x` is a shortcut for `x catch |err| return err`, and is commonly used where
handling an error isn't appropriate. Zig's
[`try`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#try) and
[`catch`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#catch) are unrelated to
try-catch in other languages.

<CodeBlock language="zig">{ErrorTry}</CodeBlock>

[`errdefer`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#errdefer) works like
[`defer`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#defer), but only executing
when the function is returned from with an error inside of the
[`errdefer`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#errdefer)'s block.

<CodeBlock language="zig">{Errdefer}</CodeBlock>

Error unions returned from a function can have their error sets inferred by not
having an explicit error set. This inferred error set contains all possible
errors that the function may return.

<CodeBlock language="zig">{ErrorSetInferred}</CodeBlock>

Error sets can be merged.

<CodeBlock language="zig">{ErrorSetMerge}</CodeBlock>

`anyerror` is the global error set, which due to being the superset of all error
sets, can have an error from any set coerced to it. Its usage should be
generally avoided.
