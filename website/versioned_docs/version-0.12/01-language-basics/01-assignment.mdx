# Assignment

Value assignment has the following syntax:
`(const|var) identifier[: type] = value`.

- `const` indicates that `identifier` is a **constant** that stores an immutable
  value.
- `var` indicates that `identifier` is a **variable** that stores a mutable
  value.
- `: type` is a type annotation for `identifier`, and may be omitted if the data
  type of `value` can be inferred.

Constants and variables _must_ have a value. If no known value can be given, the
[`undefined`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#undefined) value, which
coerces to any type, may be used as long as a type annotation is provided.

Where possible, `const` values are preferred over `var` values.
