# ArrayList

The
[`std.ArrayList`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.ArrayList)
is commonly used throughout Zig, and serves as a buffer that can change in
size. `std.ArrayList(T)` is similar to C++'s `std::vector<T>` and Rust's
`Vec<T>`. The `deinit()` method frees all of the ArrayList's memory. The memory
can be read from and written to via its slice field - `.items`.

Here we will introduce the usage of the testing allocator. This is a special
allocator that only works in tests and can detect memory leaks. In your code,
use whatever allocator is appropriate.
