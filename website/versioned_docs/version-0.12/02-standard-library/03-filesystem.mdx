# Filesystem

Let's create and open a file in our current working directory, write to it, and
then read from it. Here we have to use `.seekTo` to go back to the start of the
file before reading what we have written.

<CodeBlock language="zig">{CwdCreate}</CodeBlock>

The functions
[`std.fs.openFileAbsolute`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.fs.openFileAbsolute)
and similar absolute functions exist, but we will not test them here.

We can get various information about files by using `.stat()` on them. `Stat`
also contains fields for .inode and .mode, but they are not tested here as they
rely on the current OS' types.

<CodeBlock language="zig">{Stat}</CodeBlock>

We can make directories and iterate over their contents. Here we will use an
iterator (discussed later). This directory (and its contents) will be deleted
after this test finishes.

<CodeBlock language="zig">{MakeDirIterable}</CodeBlock>
