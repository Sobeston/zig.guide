# HTTP

## Client

We have already learned a lot about [Allocators](/standard-library/allocators), [ArrayLists](/standard-library/arraylist), and [JSON](/standard-library/json) parsing, let's combine our knowledge and send our first HTTP request with Zig

<CodeBlock language="zig">{HttpSendRequest}</CodeBlock>


## Server

To showcase spinning-up the http server we're going to use the approach from the [Threads](/standard-library/threads) chapter which we read before

<CodeBlock language="zig">{HttpReceiveResponse}</CodeBlock>
