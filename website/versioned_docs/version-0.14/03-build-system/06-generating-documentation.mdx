# Generating Documentation

Zig's documentation generation makes use of _doc comments_, using `///`. These
doc comments will "attach" themselves to the declarations found under them.
File-level doc comments can also be made at the top of a file with `//!`.

The Zig compiler comes with documentation generation. This can be invoked by
adding `-femit-docs` to your `zig build-{exe, lib, obj}` or `zig run`command.
This documentation is saved into `./docs`, as a small static website.

Here we will save this file as `src/main.zig` and build documentation for it with
`zig build-lib -femit-docs src/main.zig`.

<CodeBlock language="zig">{Main}</CodeBlock>

We should now have a folder called `docs/`. To view these docs nicely, you may
want to start a (local) static web server. Here's some commands you might be
able to use on your system without installing anything new:

- `caddy file-server --root docs/ --listen :8000`
- `python -m http.server 8000 -d docs/`

Take a few minutes to browse around. Notice that the left side of an error set
merge will take precedence over the right side, when it comes to differing doc
comments on the same error name. In our case this means that
`OpenError.InvalidSheet` will have the doc comment from
`OpenFileError.InvalidSheet`, rather than from `ParseError.InvalidSheet`.

The Zig compiler itself has the `zig std` command, which automatically serves a
web server with the standard library documentation, however as of writing this
server isn't exposed to the build system. The Zig standard library documentation
can also be found [here](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/).

When using Zig Build, generated docs can be found by using `getEmittedDocs()` on
a Compile step. Here's an example of a `build.zig` that generates documentation:

<CodeBlock language="zig">{Build}</CodeBlock>
