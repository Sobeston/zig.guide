# Assignment

Value assignment has the following syntax:
`(const|var) identifier[: type] = value`.

- `const` indicates that `identifier` is a **constant** that stores an immutable
  value.
- `var` indicates that `identifier` is a **variable** that stores a mutable
  value.
- `: type` is a type annotation for `identifier`, and may be omitted if the data
  type of `value` can be inferred.

<CodeBlock language="zig">{Assignment}</CodeBlock>

Constants and variables _must_ have a value. If no known value can be given, the
[`undefined`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#undefined) value, which
coerces to any type, may be used as long as a type annotation is provided.

:::js

If you're familiar with JavaScript, you might be used to using `undefined` as a
way to represent a variable that hasn't been initialised, or to represent an
absence of value.

However in Zig, using `undefined` like this is a bad idea as `undefined` works
very differently. In JavaScript, values can be checked for being undefined,
whereas in Zig, an undefined value is impossible to detect. Usage of undefined
values is not safe. Zig's undefined is "undefined" as in "undefined behaviour",
and should not be used as a stand-in for an optional.

Need optionals? These are [covered later](./23-optionals.mdx).

:::

Where possible, `const` values are preferred over `var` values.
