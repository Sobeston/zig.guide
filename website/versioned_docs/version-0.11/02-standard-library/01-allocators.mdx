# Allocators

The Zig standard library provides a pattern for allocating memory, which allows
the programmer to choose precisely how memory allocations are done within the
standard library - no allocations happen behind your back in the standard
library.

The most basic allocator is
[`std.heap.page_allocator`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.heap.page_allocator).
Whenever this allocator makes an allocation, it will ask your OS for entire
pages of memory; an allocation of a single byte will likely reserve multiple
kibibytes. As asking the OS for memory requires a system call, this is also
extremely inefficient for speed.

Here, we allocate 100 bytes as a `[]u8`. Notice how defer is used in conjunction
with a free - this is a common pattern for memory management in Zig.

The
[`std.heap.FixedBufferAllocator`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.heap.FixedBufferAllocator)
is an allocator that allocates memory into a fixed buffer and does not make any
heap allocations. This is useful when heap usage is not wanted, for example,
when writing a kernel. It may also be considered for performance reasons. It
will give you the error `OutOfMemory` if it has run out of bytes.

[`std.heap.ArenaAllocator`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.heap.ArenaAllocator)
takes in a child allocator and allows you to allocate many times and only free
once. Here, `.deinit()` is called on the arena, which frees all memory. Using
`allocator.free` in this example would be a no-op (i.e. does nothing).

<CodeBlock language="zig">{AllocatorsArena}</CodeBlock>

`alloc` and `free` are used for slices. For single items, consider using
`create` and `destroy`.

<CodeBlock language="zig">{AllocatorsCreate}</CodeBlock>

The Zig standard library also has a general purpose allocator. This is a safe
allocator which can prevent double-free, use-after-free and can detect leaks.
Safety checks and thread safety can be turned off via its configuration struct
(left empty below). Zig's GPA is designed for safety over performance, but may
still be many times faster than page_allocator.

<CodeBlock language="zig">{AllocatorsGpa}</CodeBlock>

For high performance (but very few safety features!),
[`std.heap.c_allocator`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.heap.c_allocator)
may be considered. This,however, has the disadvantage of requiring linking Libc,
which can be done with `-lc`.

Benjamin Feng's talk
[_What's a Memory Allocator Anyway?_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHWiDx_l4V0)
goes into more detail on this topic, and covers the implementation of
allocators.
