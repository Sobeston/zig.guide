# Hello World

Create a file called `main.zig`, with the following contents:

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() void {
    std.debug.print("Hello, {s}!\n", .{"World"});
}
```

Use `zig run main.zig` to build and run it. In this example, `Hello, World!`
will be written to stderr, and is assumed to never fail.

:::warning found 'invalid bytes'
Make sure your `main.zig` file is UTF-8 encoded as the Zig compiler does not currently support other encodings. To re-encode your file as UTF-8, run `zig fmt main.zig` and reopen the file in your editor.
