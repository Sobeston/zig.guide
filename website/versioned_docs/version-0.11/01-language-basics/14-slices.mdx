# Slices

Slices can be thought of as a pair of `[*]T` (the pointer to the data) and a
`usize` (the element count). Their syntax is `[]T`, with `T` being the child
type. Slices are used heavily throughout Zig for when you need to operate on
arbitrary amounts of data. Slices have the same attributes as pointers, meaning
that there also exists const slices. For loops also operate over slices. String
literals in Zig coerce to `[]const u8`.

Here, the syntax `x[n..m]` is used to create a slice from an array. This is
called **slicing**, and creates a slice of the elements starting at `x[n]` and
ending at `x[m - 1]`. This example uses a const slice, as the values to which
the slice points need not be modified.

When these `n` and `m` values are both known at compile time, slicing will
actually produce a pointer to an array. This is not an issue as a pointer to an
array i.e. `*[N]T` will coerce to a `[]T`.

The syntax `x[n..]` can also be used when you want to slice to the end.

```zig
test "slices 3" {
    var array = [_]u8{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
    var slice = array[0..];
    _ = slice;
}
```

Types that may be sliced are arrays, many pointers and slices.
