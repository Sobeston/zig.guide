# Many-item Pointers

Most programs need to keep track of buffers which don't have compile-time known
lengths. Many-item pointers are used for these. These act similarly to their
single-item counterparts, using the syntax `[*]T` instead of `*T`.

Here's a rundown of the differences between single and multi-item pointers.

|                               | Single-item pointers        | Multi-item pointers              |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Dereferenceable               | Yes, e.g. `ptr.*`           | No                               |
| Indexable                     | No                          | Yes, e.g. `ptr[0]`               |
| Supports Arithmetic           | No                          | Yes, e.g. `ptr + 1` or `ptr - 1` |
| Item size                     | Any size, including unknown | Must be known                    |
| Coerces from an array pointer | No                          | Yes                              |

Many-item pointers can have all of the same attributes, such as `const`, as
single-item pointers.

In this example code, we've written a function that can take in a buffer of any
length. Notice how a single-item pointer to an array of bytes coerces into a
many-item pointer of bytes.

Think about what might happen if you passed that function the incorrect
`byte_count`. The programmer is expected to keep track of (or otherwise know)
the length of these buffers. It's worth noting that this function is effectively
trusting us to pass us a valid length for the given buffer.

We can convert from a many-item pointer to a single-item pointer by either
indexing an element and referencing that, or by using `@ptrCast` to cast the
pointer type. This is only valid when the buffer has a length of at least 1.
